	abstract = {BBR is a recently proposed congestion control. Instead of using packet loss as congestion signal, like many currently used congestion controls, it uses an estimate of the available bottleneck link bandwidth to determine its sending rate. BBR tries to provide high link utilization while avoiding to create queues in bottleneck buffers. The original publication of BBR shows that it can deliver superior performance compared to Cubic TCP in some environments. This paper provides an independent and extensive experimental evaluation of BBR at higher speeds. The experimental setup uses BBR's Linux kernel 4.9 implementation and typical data rates of 10Gbit/s and 1 Gbit/s at the bottleneck link. The experiments vary the flows' round-trip times, the number of flows, and buffer sizes at the bottleneck. The evaluation considers throughput, queuing delay, packet loss, and fairness. On the one hand, the intended behavior of BBR could be observed with our experiments. On the other hand, some severe inherent issues such as increased queuing delays, unfairness, and massive packet loss were also detected. The paper provides an in-depth discussion of BBR's behavior in different experiment setups.},

	abstract = {Active queue management (AQM) techniques have evolved in the recent years, after defining the bufferbloat problem. In parallel novel congestion control (CC) algorithms have been developed to achieve better data transport performance, often assuming simple tail dropping buffers. On the other hand, AQM algorithms usually assume legacy CC (Cubic). Though all of the novel AQM and CC algorithms improve the performance under these assumptions, their co-existence has not or only partially been tested so far. Similarly, router buffer sizing was studied mainly in the 2000s, also assuming traditional CC and tail dropping buffers. In this paper we show that combining the different AQMs and CCs evolved in the past few years results in poor fairness, because assumptions used during development do not hold in this heterogeneous case. We also show that while a non-traditional AQM, using core-stateless resource sharing control, has the potential to harmonize conflicting CCs, it suffers from deployment issues. We argue that when dimensioning router buffers in networks where connections with different CCs coexist, the right choice of AQM is more important than the size of the buffer itself.},

	abstract = {In addition to classic ones, a new family of congestion controls regarded as “scalable” has recently emerged. Scalable congestion control exploits ECN to provide much ﬁner control as rate scales, enabling reactions proportional to the congestion level. Nowadays, different initiatives propose the use of Scalable congestion control over the public Internet, with the separation of Scalable and Classic ﬂows. Similar to classic approaches, the evolution of Scalable congestion control has also begun as BBRv2 implemented a “DCTCP-inspired” ECN mechanism. In this paper, we investigate the compatibility of two available Scalable congestion controls, Data Center TCP, and Google’s recent proposal called BBRv2, and evaluate them with different ECN marking strategies. Our evaluation relies on numerous measurements carried out in our testbed with 1 to 10Gbps bottleneck capacities and heterogeneous round trip times. At the bottleneck, the ECN marking of two traditional AQMs (STEP and PI2) most commonly proposed for Scalable ﬂows and a non-traditional core-stateless AQM (CSAQM) using in-network resource sharing control is examined. After showing compatibility issues, we conclude that as long as the end-to-end ﬂows control resource sharing, it will be tough to create a new, evolved congestion control that is fair to legacy solutions, and its deployment does not harm the Internet.},

It provides the entire game experience to the users remotely from a data center. The player is no longer dependent on a specific type or quality of gaming hardware, but is able to use common devices. The end device only needs a broadband internet connection and the ability to display High Definition (HD) video. While this may reduce hardware costs for users and increase the revenue for developers by leaving out the retail chain, it also raises new challenges for service quality in terms of bandwidth and latency for the underlying network. In this paper we present the results of a subjective user study we conducted into the user-perceived quality of experience (QoE) in Cloud Gaming. We design a measurement environment, that emulates this new type of service, define tests for users to assess the QoE, derive Key Influence Factors (KFI) and influences of content and perception from our results.},

One of the key usage scenarios in the scope of 5G is ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC). Among the active researchers from both academy and industry, one common view is that URLLC will play an essential role in providing connectivity for the new services and applications from vertical domains, such as factory automation, autonomous driving and so on. The most important key performance indicators (KPIs) related to URLLC are latency, reliability and availability. In this paper, after brief discussion on the design challenges related to URLLC use cases, we present an overview of the available technology components from 3GPP Rel-15 and potential ones from Rel-16. In addition, coordinated multi-cell resource allocation methods are studied. From the system level simulation results in an urban macro environment, it can be observed that effective multi-cell cooperation, more specifically soft combining, can lead to a significant gain in terms of URLLC capacity.},

We show that simple packet delay, measured as round-trip times at hosts, is an effective congestion signal without the need for switch feedback. First, we show that advances in NIC hardware have made RTT measurement possible with microsecond accuracy, and that these RTTs are sufficient to estimate switch queueing. Then we describe how TIMELY can adjust transmission rates using RTT gradients to keep packet latency low while delivering high bandwidth. We implement our design in host software running over NICs with OS-bypass capabilities. We show using experiments with up to hundreds of machines on a Clos network topology that it provides excellent performance: turning on TIMELY for OS-bypass messaging over a fabric with PFC lowers 99 percentile tail latency by 9X while maintaining near line-rate throughput. Our system also outperforms DCTCP running in an optimized kernel, reducing tail latency by \$13\$X. To the best of our knowledge, TIMELY is the first delay-based congestion control protocol for use in the datacenter, and it achieves its results despite having an order of magnitude fewer RTT signals (due to NIC offload) than earlier delay-based schemes such as Vegas.},

Today, low delays can only be achieved if there are no congested links along the path. At a bottleneck, the commonly used congestion control mechanisms induce high queuing delay and packet loss. Specialized congestion control mechanisms achieving a low queuing delay in an otherwise congested network exist. However, if their flows share a bottleneck with traditionally congestion controlled flows, they get suppressed or loose their low-delay property. This paper presents three approaches - Separate Paths, Separate Queues and Limited Queue - that enable coexistence of congestion control mechanisms that are optimized for different goals, e.g., interactive applications and bulk transfers.

These approaches enable Vegas to achieve its fair share of bandwidth, even gaining an advantage over Reno, encouraging users to switch their TCP from Reno to Vegas.},

QUIC has been globally deployed at Google on thousands of servers and is used to serve traffic to a range of clients including a widely-used web browser (Chrome) and a popular mobile video streaming app (YouTube). We estimate that 7\% of Internet traffic is now QUIC. We describe our motivations for developing a new transport, the principles that guided our design, the Internet-scale process that we used to perform iterative experiments on QUIC, performance improvements seen by our various services, and our experience deploying QUIC globally. We also share lessons about transport design and the Internet ecosystem that we learned from our deployment.},

Initiated by Google in 2012, QUIC provides a reliable, connection-oriented low-latency and fully encrypted transport. In this paper, we provide the first broad assessment of QUIC usage in the wild. We monitor the entire IPv4 address space since August 2016 and about 46\% of the DNS namespace to detected QUIC-capable infrastructures. Our scans show that the number of QUIC-capable IPs has more than tripled since then to over 617.59 K. We find around 161 K domains hosted on QUIC-enabled infrastructure, but only 15 K of them present valid certificates over QUIC. Second, we analyze one year of traffic traces provided by MAWI, one day of a major European tier-1 ISP and from a large IXP to understand the dominance of QUIC in the Internet traffic mix. We find QUIC to account for 2.6\% to 9.1\% of the current Internet traffic, depending on the vantage point. This share is dominated by Google pushing up to 42.1\% of its traffic via QUIC.},

	abstract = {TCP's congestion control is deliberately cautious, avoiding network overloads by starting with a small initial window and then iteratively ramping up. As a result, it often takes flows several round-trip times to fully utilize the available bandwidth. In this paper we propose RC3, a technique to quickly take advantage of available capacity from the very first RTT. RC3 uses several levels of lower priority service and a modified TCP behavior to achieve near-optimal throughputs while preserving TCP-friendliness and fairness. We implement RC3 in the Linux kernel and in NS-3. In common wide-area scenarios, RC3 results in over 40\% reduction in average flow completion times, with strongest improvements - more than 70\% reduction in flow completion time - seen in medium to large sized (100KB - 3MB) flows.},

	abstract = {The problem of overbuffering in today's Internet (termed as bufferbloat) has recently drawn a great amount of attention from the research community. This has led to the development of various active queue management (AQM) schemes. The last years have seen a lot of effort to show the benefits of AQMs over simple tail-drop queuing and to encourage deployment. Yet it is still unknown to what extent AQMs are deployed in the Internet. In this paper, we present an end-to-end active measurement method to detect AQMs on the path bottleneck. We have developed an active measurement tool, named {\textbackslash}emph\{TADA\}, and evaluated our measurement methodology on a controlled experimental testbed. Experimental results show that the proposed approach provides the basis to identify whether an AQM is deployed on the bottleneck.},

We assume that we are given a source-to-sink path of interest -along which a bottleneck router exists- and data regarding the Round-Trip Times (RTT) and Congestion Window (CWND) sizes with respect to this flow. We develop a reliable classification algorithm that solely uses RTT and CWND information pertaining to a single flow to classify the queuing scheme, Tail Drop or AQM, used by the bottleneck router. We evaluate our method and present results that demonstrate our algorithm's highly accurate classification ability across a wide array of complex network topologies and configurations.},
